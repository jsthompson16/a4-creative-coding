## Pokemon Generation 1 Data Visualization

http://a4-jarodthompson.glitch.me

My website represents each first generation Pokemon by a circle with an appropriate color based on its type and its name. 
Users are able to change the starting x and y position of the circles, the variance that each circle moves from that 
starting position in both the x and y direction, the alpha values of the circles, and the radii of the circles. 

One challenge I faced was getting the display of circles to update along with the dat.gui value changes. Another challenge
was getting the svg circles to display on the entire window rather than the small initial svg values.

I used eslint as my JS linter, using rules such as always using semi-colons, the allowance for single line if else statements
if possible but requiring brackets everywhere else, the use of only double quotes, indents always being tabs, and some array formatting.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Accessibility**: There are no div or span elements in my document.
